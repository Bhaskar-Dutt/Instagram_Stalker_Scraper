# Instagram_stalker-scrapper-
Fetch data of any public Instagram profile

First of all, I want to say that this project helps me learn a lot of things about web scraping and many python libraries (some of them aren't used)

Now what this does is, it downloads all the posts(including videos) of any PUBLIC instagram account and save it in your current working directory.
And it also shows the bar graph (likes of each post) from older to newer posts.

When i started this project, I googled alot of things(don't remember) and visited alot of blogs. Thanks everyone :)
But there is one blog that tells exactly how to scrape the AJAX part or infinie scrolling of instagram account.

Infinite Scrolling - https://www.diggernaut.com/blog/how-to-scrape-pages-infinite-scroll-extracting-data-from-instagram/#comment-157

I recommend visiting this blog and google the term that you don't understand from the blog (like XHR and many more).

And one final advice - Go through the requests library if you programmming with python.

Requests Lib - http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/quickstart/

And if you are intersted in plotting graph in python:

Matplotlib - https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/introductory/sample_plots.html

Good Luck!
